# Ad Click Predictor Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement.  
The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and includes user demographics, session behavior, and ad-related features.

## üéØ Objective

The objective is to help marketers and platforms optimize ad targeting and improve click-through rates (CTR) by predicting the likelihood of a user interacting with an ad.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaned and encoded raw data including age, gender, timestamp, ad topic line, etc.

- **Modeling:**  
  Trained and evaluated a **Logistic Regression** model to find the best-performing algorithm.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Used **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to assess model performance.

- **Result:**  
  Achieved high precision and recall, minimizing false positives and improving ad targeting efficiency.
