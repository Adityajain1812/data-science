# 🏫 KMeans University Analysis

In this project, we apply **KMeans Clustering**, an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**, to group universities into two categories: **Private** and **Public**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to apply KMeans Clustering to group universities into two categories—Private and Public—based solely on institutional features such as:

- Application statistics  
- Tuition and financial information  
- Faculty qualifications  
- Student demographics  

---

## 🌟 Main Features

- 🔍 **Identify natural groupings** in the data without using labeled information.

- 📊 **Evaluate the effectiveness** of KMeans clustering by comparing the predicted clusters with the actual labels *(used only after clustering)*.

- ⚠️ **Demonstrate the limitations** of applying supervised evaluation metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, classification report) in an unsupervised learning context.

- 🧠 **Provide insight** into how university attributes influence their clustering and whether they align with Public or Private classifications.
