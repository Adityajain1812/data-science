# 📊 Payback Predictor using Random Forest

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan. By analyzing financial and personal data, it uses a Random Forest classifier to make reliable predictions and support credit risk assessment.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a borrower will repay a loan or default, based on historical financial and personal data. This model aims to assist lenders and financial institutions in making informed, data-driven credit decisions, reducing risk, and improving loan approval processes.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
