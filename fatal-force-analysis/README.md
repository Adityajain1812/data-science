# Fatal Force Analysis Project  

This project investigates patterns of fatal encounters involving law enforcement in the United States and examines how these incidents intersect with socio-economic and demographic factors. By combining multiple datasetsâ€”including fatal police encounters, household income, education attainment, poverty levels, and racial demographicsâ€”the project aims to provide a holistic understanding of the underlying conditions associated with fatal force.
