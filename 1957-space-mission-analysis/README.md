# ðŸš€ 1957 Space Mission Analysis â€“ Project Overview  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

The launch of *Sputnik-1* in **1957** by the Soviet Union marked the beginning of the space age and initiated the space race between the **USA** and the **Soviet Union**. This project analyzes space mission data to trace the journey of space exploration from its origins to the modern era.  

The dataset contains information about **organisations, launch locations, mission dates, rocket status, costs, and outcomes**. By analyzing these attributes, the project provides insights into the **evolution of space missions**, the **competition between the USA and the Soviet Union**, and the **long-term patterns in global space exploration**.  

## ðŸ“Š Analytical Approach  

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Standardizing dates  
  - Handling missing costs  
  - Categorizing mission outcomes  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Mission frequency over time  
  - Success rates by country and organisation  
  - Cost distribution across missions  
  - Geographic distribution of launch sites  

- **Visualization**  
  - Timelines  
  - Bar charts  
  - Comparative success rate plots
